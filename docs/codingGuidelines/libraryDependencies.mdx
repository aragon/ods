# Library Dependencies

## Dependencies

The `@aragon/ods` library relies on the dependencies listed under the `dependencies` section to function correctly.
These dependencies are not bundled with the library, but when you add `@aragon/ods` to your application, the package
manager will install them if they are missing in the current project.

## Peer Dependencies

The `peerDependencies` section lists optional dependencies that are not included in the library bundle and will not be
automatically installed by the package manager. Consumers of the library are responsible for installing these
dependencies.

## Dev Dependencies

The `devDependencies` section includes dependencies that are essential for documentation and development purposes. These
dependencies are not included in the library bundle, and users do not need to install them when using the library in
their applications.

## Recommendations

For the dependencies listed under the `dependencies` or `peerDependencies` sections, make sure to:

-   **Use Relaxed Versions:** We recommend specifying relaxed versions for dependencies listed under the `dependencies`
    section. For example, use `"react": "^18.0.0"` instead of specifying an exact version like `"react": "18.2.2"`. This
    practice allows for flexibility and helps prevent conflicts with other libraries.

-   **Support Major Versions:** Whenever possible, support multiple major versions of dependencies. For instance, use
    `"react": "^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0"` to accommodate a broader range of applications.

For the dependencies listed under the `devDependencies` section, make sure to:

-   **Keep Dependencies Updated:** It's crucial to regularly update the dependencies listed under `devDependencies` to
    benefit from the latest features, bug fixes, and improvements during development. This practice ensures that your
    development environment remains current and efficient.
