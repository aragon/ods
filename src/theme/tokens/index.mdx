# Tokens

The design tokens in the `@aragon/ods` UI library serve as the foundational elements for creating consistent and
visually appealing interfaces. These tokens are implemented using
[CSS custom variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) and, when integrated with Tailwind CSS,
they can be conveniently accessed through Tailwind classes. When used as a standalone library, design tokens should be
used as CSS custom properties.

## Usage

### With Tailwind CSS

In projects using both `@aragon/ods` and `Tailwind CSS`, design tokens are readily available as Tailwind classes. For
instance:

```html
<div class="mt-2 bg-primary-500">
    <!-- Content with design tokens applied -->
</div>
```

### Standalone Usage

When using `@aragon/ods` as a standalone library, design tokens are applied as CSS custom properties. For example:

```css
.my-section {
    margin-top: var(--ods-space-2);
    color: var(--ods-color-primary-500);
}
```

## Categories

-   **Primitive**: Establish the core elements of the design system, including colors, typography, spacing, and more.

-   **Semantic (SOON)**: Provide an abstraction layer over primitive tokens, enabling the definition of application
    themes.

-   **Component-Specific (SOON)**: Allow users to customize individual components according to their preferences.
